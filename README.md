# Deep-Projects(Power of no GAN)


Coloring a Anime Happy Sugar Life, this project colors the Happy Sugar Life Anime after it is being processed to black and white. I love this Anime because it talks about a girl whose parent passed away and search for love.
Left is input, middle is prediction, and the right is the truth label.
Thus, you can see it is not perfect that it often only colors the hair and face rather than the clothes too. That is because I used a pre-trained model that can only do that. In the future if I have enought time, I will make it better if I have time...

Second Project, It is a natural disaster damage level classification on house. I can see my model is even better than human that can pick some unlabeled picture.
Right picture is prediction and the left is truth label or correct answer.
